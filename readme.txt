TourmalineEngine V0.1(Alpha)


Greetings, this is a follow-up project to my previous endeavour (TanksProj)
This Framework aims at being an easy and intuitive tool for 3D graphics and physical simulation.

Possible usages include:
3D games, CAD, physical simulation and visualization.

My engine is strictly divided into the following modules:


Tourmaline Graphics
    It is based on the OpenGL API [4.6, GLSL 460]
    PBR
    ShadowMapping
    Nuklear UI

Tourmaline Physics
    RigidBody physics
        Plane Physics
    Collision [ Future ]

Tourmaline IO
    Supported as of now:
        Mouse
        Keyboard

Tourmaline Sound
     OpenAL
