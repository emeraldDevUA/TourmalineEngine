1. Albedo (Base Color) Map: This map contains the base color information of the material without any lighting or shadowing effects. It represents the intrinsic color of the surface.
2. Normal Map: This map is used to add surface detail without increasing the geometric complexity. It alters the surface normals to create the illusion of depth and detail.
3. Metalness (Metallic) Map: This map defines which parts of the material are metallic and which are non-metallic (dielectric). It influences the reflectivity and the way light interacts with the surface.
4. Roughness Map: This map determines the smoothness or roughness of the surface. It affects the spread and blurriness of reflections on the material.
5. Ambient Occlusion (AO) Map: This map is used to simulate self-shadowing where indirect lighting is occluded. It adds depth and realism to the scene by darkening crevices and other areas where light is less likely to reach.
6. Height (Displacement) Map: This map is used for more accurate parallax effects and can be used to displace the actual geometry of the surface, adding real geometric detail rather than just shading effects.
7. Specular Map (if using the specular workflow instead of metalness): This map defines the intensity and color of the specular highlights. It can be used in workflows that separate specular and glossiness from metalness and roughness.
8. Emission Map: This map is used for materials that emit light. It defines the parts of the surface that should glow and the intensity of the emitted light.
9. Subsurface Scattering (SSS) Map: For materials that allow light to penetrate their surface and scatter within, like skin or wax, this map helps define how light scatters beneath the surface.
10. Anisotropy Map: This map controls the direction and intensity of anisotropic reflections, which are common in materials like brushed metal or hair.
11. Opacity (Transparency) Map: This map controls the transparency levels of the surface, determining which parts are transparent and by how much.

These maps have to be implemented.

Also what needs to be implemented is deferred rendering. This type of rendering is going to
ensure that enough post-processing capacity is provided for you as a developer.

an additional requirement is shadow mapping.
IMO it has to be PCF Soft Shadow Mapping.

Enhanced MTL is a file that is used to store mtlib files that correspond to the Disney MTL extension.

Maps are not supported since they are already intended to be placed with the model itself.
loading maps from mtlib is only going to cause more confusion.
