It's mostly that the Wavefront OBJ is going to be used to load 3D models and material libraries.

    By default, a 3d resource folder is configured. let it be ..../3d_res
after which you have to create a folder with a 3d model and a .mtl file.
If all the files are parsed correctly, this mechanism provides a developer with a
convenient and framework-like way to load 3D model in PBR.

If you are not willing to do that, you can still load models and textures manually, however
this option may result in unnecessary code overhead, which is rarely a good idea.

Obj splines are only expected to have limited support:
One at a file and standalone(They won't be interpreted together with obj files).
