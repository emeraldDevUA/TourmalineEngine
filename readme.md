Greetings, this is a follow-up project to my previous endeavour (TanksProj)
This Framework aims at being an easy and intuitive tool for 3D graphics and physical simulation.

Possible usages include:
3D games, CAD, physical simulation and visualization.

My engine is strictly divided into the following modules:

- ## Tourmaline Graphics
1. It is based on the OpenGL API [4.6, GLSL 460]
2. PBR
3. ShadowMapping
4. ImGUI UI

- ## Tourmaline Physics
1. RigidBody physics
2. Plane Physics 
3. Collision [ Future ]

- ## Tourmaline IO
**Supported as of now:**
1. Mouse 
2. Keyboard

- ## Tourmaline Sound (Future)
1. OpenAL
